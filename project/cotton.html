				<p class="cotton__info--para1">
					Cotton is a highly valued material known for its superior
					characteristics. It is grown using sustainable and eco-friendly
					farming practices that preserve the environment and protect the health
					of farmers and communities. Our quality cotton is free from harmful
					chemicals, making it ideal for those with sensitive skin or allergies.
				</p>
				<ul class="cotton__info--para1_list">
					<li class="cotton__info--para1_list-item">
						Cotton is widely chosen for clothing due to its softness,
						breathability, and durability. It provides comfort against the skin,
						regulates body temperature, and withstands frequent washing without
						losing shape or getting damaged. Cotton's versatility allows it to
						be woven into various textures and patterns for different clothing
						styles and designs.
					</li>
					<li class="cotton__info--para1_list-item">
						High-quality cotton is characterized by its superior properties,
						including long and strong fibers, vibrant colors, and excellent
						absorbency. It offers exceptional durability, softness, and
						breathability, making it ideal for bedding, clothing, and towels.
					</li>
					<li class="cotton__info--para1_list-item">
						Cotton production is carried out using organic and sustainable
						practices, ensuring the highest quality possible. Ethical and
						socially responsible manufacturing practices are followed, including
						fair labor and trade standards, to ensure workers are treated fairly
						and have safe working conditions.
					</li>
				</ul>

						class="cotton__info--para2_img"

					<p class="cotton__info--para2">
						There are four main types of cotton: Pima Cotton, known for its long
						and luxurious fibers; Egyptian Cotton, renowned for its exceptional
						quality and luxurious feel; Upland Cotton, widely grown and
						commercially significant; and Organic Cotton, produced using
						sustainable farming practices without synthetic chemicals. Each type
						has unique qualities that determine its suitability for different
						applications.
					</p>
				</div>

				<p class="cotton__info--para3">
					Harvest systems in cotton farming include mechanized harvesting,
					handpicking, and stripper harvesting, depending on factors such as
					labor requirements and desired quality. Pest management strategies,
					such as Integrated Pest Management (IPM) practices, are implemented to
					control pests and minimize damage while reducing reliance on chemical
					pesticides. Regular monitoring and proactive intervention are
					essential for successful pest management in cotton production.
