    <h1>Types of Cotton</h1>

    <p>there are many different varieties of cotton within each type. Each variety has its own unique characteristics
      in
      terms of fiber length, strength, and other properties, which can affect its suitability for different
      applications.
    </p>

    <p>There are 4 types of cotton:</p><br>
    <div class="card-container">
      <div class="card">
        <h2>1. Pima Cotton</h2>
        <p> Pima cotton is a high-quality type of cotton that is known for its extra-long staple fibers. The
          cotton is native to South America and the American Southwest, and is considered to be the finest type of
          cotton
          in
          the world. Pima cotton is known for its softness, durability, and resistance to fading, tearing, and
          wrinkling.
          It
          is commonly used in high-end clothing and luxury linens.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h2>2. Egyptian Cotton</h2>
        <p> Egyptian cotton is another high-quality type of cotton that is known for its extra-long staple
          fibers. It is very similar to pima cotton, and the two are even in the same scientific class: gossypium
          barbadense.
          Egyptian cotton is grown in the Nile River Valley in Egypt, where the warm climate and fertile soil create
          ideal
          growing conditions. Egyptian cotton is known for its softness, strength, and luster, and is commonly used in
          luxury
          linens and clothing.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h2>
          3. Upland Cotton</h2>
        <p> Upland cotton is the most common type of cotton and makes up about 90% of the world's total
          cotton
          production. It is grown in a wide range of countries, including the United States, China, India, and Pakistan.
          Upland cotton has shorter staple fibers than pima and Egyptian cotton, which makes it less expensive to
          produce.
          However, it is still a durable and versatile type of cotton that is commonly used in a wide range of products,
          including clothing, bedding, and industrial materials.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h2>
          4. Organic Cotton</h2>
        <p> Organic cotton is any type of cotton that is grown without the use of synthetic chemicals and
          from plants that are not genetically modified. Organic cotton is grown using methods that promote soil health,
          water
          conservation, and biodiversity. It is typically grown in smaller quantities than conventional cotton, and is
          often
          more expensive to produce. However, organic cotton is becoming increasingly popular due to concerns about the
          environmental and health impacts of conventional cotton production. Organic cotton is commonly used in
          clothing,
          bedding, and other textiles.</p>
