High quality cotton
Production of high-quality cotton lint begins with variety selection,
continues with attention to all cotton production practices, and ends
with a well-planned and well-executed cotton harvest.


Harvest systems
Our cotton harvest systems are designed to efficiently and effectively
remove cotton bolls from the plant while minimizing damage to the
cotton fibers.
Our mechanical harvest involves the use of special equipment, such as
cotton pickers and strippers to ensure no cotton fibers are damaged.
Manual harvest involves hand picking cotton bolls where mechanical
harvest isn't suitable.

Pest management
Cotton pest management is a critical aspect of cotton production, as
pests such as boll weevils, aphids, and mites can significantly reduce
crop yields and quality.
Here we use a variety of methods to manage pests, including cultural
practices like crop rotation and mechanical practices like removing
infested plants.
Instead of pesticides which are known to be harmful to humans, we use
alternative pest management strategies and biocontrol, which use
natural enemies of pests to control their population.
